About the ANPAN

Welcome to the Association of Nepalis in Psychology and Neuroscience (ANPAN)! We are a vibrant community that unites all Nepalis, including experts, students, researchers, and those simply curious about the fascinating field of neuroscience and psychology. Our platform serves to bring the knowledge of neuroscience and psychology to the general public in society and make it not only accessible but also practical and relevant to everyday lives. At ANPAN, we create education modules, organize monthly lecture series and discussion series, and various other things that bring together knowledge from diverse perspectives to create contents and resources that have the potential to transform individuals at their day-to-day level.  

Moreover, ANPAN provides a nurturing platform where individuals come together, offering mutual support across research endeavors, career pathways, and numerous opportunities within the intricate tapestry of neuroscience and psychology.
